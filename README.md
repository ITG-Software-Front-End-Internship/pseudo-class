# pseudo-class

This project is a simple demonstration of using CSS pseudo-classes, specifically `:first-of-type`, to style elements in an HTML document.

## Demo

See it live: [https://diaahsharqawi.github.io/pseudo-class/](https://diaahsharqawi.github.io/pseudo-class/)

## Features

- Shows how to target and style only the first `<p>` element within a container using the `:first-of-type` pseudo-class.
- Includes a minimal HTML structure and CSS for easy understanding.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure with a `<div>` holding headers and paragraphs.
- `styles.css`: Applies a red color to the first paragraph within the `#my-div` container using the CSS selector `#my-div > p:first-of-type`.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the effect of the CSS pseudo-class. The first paragraph inside the div will be colored red, while the second remains default.

## Purpose

This repository is intended as an educational example to illustrate the use of CSS pseudo-classes for beginners.
